# Git Setup Instructions for MacroMakerDeluxe

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Move to Parent Directory
```bash
# Copy this entire MacroMakerDeluxe folder to your parent GitHub directory
# From: C:\Users\david\Documents\GitHub\IWINButtonDKXAM\MacroMakerDeluxe
# To:   C:\Users\david\Documents\GitHub\MacroMakerDeluxe
```

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd C:\Users\david\Documents\GitHub\MacroMakerDeluxe

# Initialize new git repository
git init

# Add GitHub remote (create repository on GitHub first)
git remote add origin https://github.com/DKXAM/MacroMakerDeluxe.git
```

### Step 3: Initial Commit
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "feat: initialize MacroMakerDeluxe addon project

Universal spell rotation addon that solves the scalability problem of existing 
macro addons by working with ANY spell without hardcoding.

Key Features:
- Dynamic spell discovery from player's spellbook
- Universal condition system (resource, buffs, debuffs, health, etc.)
- Drag-and-drop GUI interface requiring no scripting knowledge
- Future-proof architecture - new spells work automatically
- Cross-class compatibility - same addon for all classes

Based on comprehensive research of EasyPrio, LazyScript, and CleveroidMacros
that identified fundamental limitations in existing approaches.

### Testing with Turtle WoW Launcher
1. Push changes to `main` branch
2. In Turtle WoW Launcher: Add GitHub addon
3. Use URL: `https://github.com/DKXAM/MacroMakerDeluxe`
4. Launcher will automatically update when you push changes

## Next Steps After Git Setup

1. **Implement Phase 1: Core Foundation**
   - Start with `Core/Utils.lua`
   - Then `Core/SpellDiscovery.lua`
   - Build and test incrementally

2. **Create Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b development
   # Do daily development work here
   # Merge to main when features are complete
   ```

3. **Set Up Issue Tracking**
   - Use GitHub Issues for feature requests
   - Track development progress
   - Community feedback and bug reports

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md as features are implemented
   - Add screenshots and usage examples
   - Create user guides and tutorials
