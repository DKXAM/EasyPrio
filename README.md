# I.W.I.N Button
Addon for **Turtle WoW**

This addon allows you to set up a rotation to cast abilities with a single button press:
- Choose the order and conditions for using abilities
- Add self-buffs to your button setup â€“ no more worrying about missing buffs
- Debuffs in your rotation will be refreshed as soon as they expire
- Create different rotations for single-target damage, AoE, farming, and more

The addon doesn't just cast abilities in a fixed order.
When you press the macro button, it checks for relevant buffs/debuffs, available energy/rage/mana, and whether the spell can be cast.
Modern AI techniques were used in the creation of this addon to let you enjoy the game instead of frantically tracking cooldowns.
